# Recommendation Flow Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the current basic loading experience in `/app/routes/recommendation.tsx` into an engaging, real-time recommendation journey with enhanced UX following the Cosmic Dark Tinted-Blur design system.

## Current State Analysis

### Onboarding Flow (app/routes/onboarding.tsx)
- Multi-step form collects user preferences (learningGoals, studyReason, level, studyPlan)
- Form submission calls `usecaseUser.saveOnboarding()` 
- Fire-and-forget pattern: client immediately navigates to `/recommendation` 
- Background recommendation service runs asynchronously at external API

### Recommendation Page (app/routes/recommendation.tsx)
- Simple TanStack Query hook `useRecommendation(userId)` 
- Basic loading state: "Loading..." text
- Carousel display of recommended courses
- Skip button to navigate to homepage "/"

### Current Problems
1. No real-time feedback during recommendation generation
2. Generic loading experience with no progress indication
3. No celebration when recommendations complete successfully
4. Poor error handling for failed or empty recommendations
5. Missed opportunity for engaging user experience

## Technical Architecture

### Sanity Schema (Existing)
```groq
// Recommendation document structure
{
  _type: 'recommendation',
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  message: string, // Status message for user
  courses: array<reference>, // Recommended courses
  createdFor: reference<user>,
  query: object, // Original user preferences
  reason: string, // AI explanation
  _createdAt: datetime,
  _updatedAt: datetime
}
```

### API Integration Points
- **External Service**: `http://localhost:4000/api/recommendations` (fire-and-forget)
- **Sanity Query**: Real-time recommendation status via GROQ
- **Current Hook**: `app/features/recommendation/hooks/get-recommendation.tsx`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Real-time Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Install Dependencies
```bash
bun add canvas-confetti @sanity/react-loader
```

#### 1.2 Create Enhanced Recommendation Hook
**File**: `app/features/recommendation/hooks/use-live-recommendation.tsx`

Features:
- Sanity Live Content API integration for real-time updates
- Background polling fallback when live updates unavailable
- Status-based loading states
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount

```typescript
// Hook signature
export function useLiveRecommendation(userId: string) {
  return {
    data: RecommendationWithCourses | null,
    status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed',
    message: string,
    isLoading: boolean,
    error: Error | null
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Sanity Live Query Setup
**File**: `app/features/recommendation/data/live-queries.ts`

- GROQ queries for real-time recommendation tracking
- Optimized query projection for performance
- Subscription cleanup management

### Phase 2: Enhanced UI/UX Components (Cosmic Dark Design)

#### 2.1 Animated Status Indicator
**File**: `app/features/recommendation/components/recommendation-status.tsx`

Features:
- Progress states with engaging messages:
  - "Analyzing your learning preferences..."
  - "Finding the perfect courses for you..."
  - "Crafting your personalized learning path..."
- Animated loading indicators following design system
- Glass card layout with `.glass-card` utility
- Proper text hierarchy using `text-primary`, `text-secondary`, `text-muted`

#### 2.2 Enhanced Loading States
**Components to Create**:
- `RecommendationProgress` - Animated progress indicator
- `StatusMessage` - Dynamic status text with smooth transitions
- `LoadingCourseCards` - Skeleton cards using glass aesthetics

**Design System Requirements**:
- Use `PageBackground` component for cosmic dark abstract background
- Apply `.tinted-blur` for all major surfaces (max 3 per viewport)
- Follow typography standards: `text-3xl md:text-5xl font-light tracking-tight`
- Implement proper spacing: 24px between sections, 12px label→content
- Ensure 44×44px minimum touch targets

#### 2.3 Responsive Layout Improvements
- Mobile-first carousel improvements
- Enhanced spacing and typography
- Better visual hierarchy with proper contrast ratios (WCAG AA)

### Phase 3: Success Celebration

#### 3.1 Confetti Integration
**File**: `app/features/recommendation/components/success-celebration.tsx`

Features:
- Canvas-confetti with custom colors matching accent system
- Trigger on recommendation completion
- Accessible alternative for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Automatic cleanup after animation

```typescript
// Confetti configuration
const confettiConfig = {
  particleCount: 100,
  spread: 70,
  origin: { y: 0.6 },
  colors: ['#3E5BFF', '#5C3BFF', '#E9EAF2'] // Match accent system
}
```

#### 3.2 Success Animation Sequence
1. Status changes to "completed"
2. Confetti animation triggers
3. Course cards animate in with staggered entrance
4. Success message appears: "Your learning journey awaits!"
5. Enhanced CTA buttons with `.btn-primary` styling

#### 3.3 Course Card Entrance Animations
- Smooth fade-in with scale animation
- Staggered timing for multiple cards
- Motion-safe fallbacks for accessibility

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Fallback Flows

#### 4.1 Failed Recommendation Handling
**Scenarios**:
- External API failure
- Sanity document creation failed
- Processing timeout (>30 seconds)

**UI Response**:
- Clear error messaging in `.glass-card` with error styling
- Retry button with loading state
- Support contact information
- Option to browse all courses manually

#### 4.2 Empty Recommendations
**Scenario**: AI generates no suitable recommendations

**UI Response**:
- Encouraging message: "Let's explore what's available"
- Direct navigation to `/courses` with filters pre-applied
- Breadcrumb showing user preferences for context

#### 4.3 Service Timeout Handling
**Scenario**: Recommendation takes longer than expected

**UI Response**:
- Progressive messaging after 15 seconds: "Taking longer than expected..."
- Skip option after 30 seconds
- Background processing continues if user chooses to wait

### Phase 5: Performance & Accessibility

#### 5.1 Performance Optimizations
- Lazy load confetti library until needed
- Efficient GROQ queries with minimal projections
- Proper cleanup of Sanity Live subscriptions
- Limit to max 3 `.tinted-blur` surfaces per viewport

#### 5.2 Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG AA color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Proper ARIA labels for loading states
- Live region announcements for status changes
- Keyboard navigation support
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support for animations

#### 5.3 Error Boundaries
- React Error Boundaries for graceful degradation
- Fallback to original simple loading if enhanced features fail
- Logging for debugging production issues
