import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { performance } from 'perf_hooks';

test.describe('Performance Tests', () => {
  test('Course page loads within 2 seconds', async ({ page }) => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    await page.goto('/courses/javascript-fundamentals');
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
    
    const endTime = performance.now();
    const loadTime = endTime - startTime;
    
    expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(2000);
  });

  test('Quiz completion performance', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test quiz interaction performance
    await page.goto('/courses/test/quiz/intro');
    
    const startTime = performance.now();
    await page.click('[data-testid="quiz-answer-a"]');
    await page.click('[data-testid="submit-quiz"]');
    await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="quiz-result"]');
    const endTime = performance.now();
    
    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(1000);
  });

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
import { logger } from './logger';

interface BusinessMetric {
  name: string;
  value: number;
  tags?: Record<string, string>;
  timestamp?: Date;
}

export class BusinessMetrics {
  static track(metric: BusinessMetric) {
    // Send to monitoring service
    Sentry.metrics.gauge(metric.name, metric.value, {
      tags: metric.tags,
      timestamp: metric.timestamp || new Date(),
    });

- Data export functionality (requires testing infrastructure)

### External Dependencies:
- Monitoring service setup (Sentry, DataDog, etc.)
- CI/CD platform configuration (GitHub Actions)
- Testing infrastructure provisioning

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Large Test Suite**: Implement parallel test execution

## 📝 Phase 3 Notes

### Critical Path Priority:
1. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automates quality and deployment
2. **Comprehensive Testing** - Prevents production issues  
3. **Advanced Monitoring** - Provides production visibility
4. **Security Hardening** - Protects user data and system integrity

### Best Practices:
- Test in production-like environments
- Monitor what matters to users and business
- Automate everything that can be automated
- Plan for failure scenarios and recovery
- Document all procedures and runbooks

### Performance Considerations:
- Test suite should complete in <10 minutes
- Monitor build and deployment performance
- Balance test thoroughness with execution speed
- Use appropriate test granularity (unit vs integration vs E2E)

**Next Phase:** After completing Phase 3, proceed to Phase 4 for legal compliance, privacy features, and final production readiness validation.
